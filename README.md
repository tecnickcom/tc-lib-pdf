## Overview

`tc-lib-pdf` is a pure-PHP library for dynamically generating PDF documents.  
It is the modern evolution of the widely used TCPDF library, redesigned around a modular package architecture, Composer-first workflow, and strict PHP type safety.

It coordinates specialized companion packages for fonts, images, graphics, pages, filtering, and encryption into a cohesive document-authoring API. The result is a production-ready toolkit for invoices, reports, labels, and other generated PDFs where predictable output and long-term maintainability matter.

## Description

`tc-lib-pdf` is a modern PDF generation library for PHP applications that need deterministic document output without delegating rendering to an external service. It builds on the long-standing ideas behind TCPDF, but reshapes them into a cleaner, Composer-native package designed for contemporary PHP development.

For teams already familiar with TCPDF, this project offers a more modular foundation with stronger typing, clearer package boundaries, and an API surface intended to be easier to maintain in large codebases. For teams adopting it fresh, it provides a practical way to generate production PDFs directly from PHP while retaining fine-grained control over layout, typography, graphics, metadata, and standards-oriented output.

The library is particularly well suited to backend-driven document workflows such as invoices, shipping labels, statements, certificates, reports, and archived business records. Instead of treating PDF generation as an opaque export step, `tc-lib-pdf` exposes the document model in a way that lets developers compose pages programmatically, integrate with existing application data, and keep output logic versioned alongside the rest of the codebase.

Because it is part of the broader `tc-lib-*` ecosystem, `tc-lib-pdf` can coordinate fonts, images, page geometry, graphics primitives, and optional features such as barcodes and encryption through dedicated companion packages. That modular design makes the project easier to evolve over time while still delivering the all-in-one capabilities PHP developers expect from a serious PDF engine.

## For TCPDF Users

If you already know TCPDF, `tc-lib-pdf` will feel familiar in purpose but it is not positioned as a drop-in replacement.

- The codebase is split across focused Composer packages instead of a single monolithic distribution.
- The API surface is more strongly typed and organized around companion services such as fonts, pages, graphics, and images.
- Setup is Composer-first, which means asset preparation such as font generation is part of project bootstrap rather than an implicit bundled step.

The fastest way to evaluate the library is to follow the installation and font setup steps below, then compare the runnable examples in [examples/index.md](examples/index.md) with the equivalent workflows you already maintain in TCPDF.

## Features

### Text & Fonts
- Full **UTF-8 Unicode** and **right-to-left** (RTL) language support
- **TrueTypeUnicode**, **OpenTypeUnicode v1**, TrueType, OpenType v1, Type1, and CID-0 fonts
- Font subsetting to keep file sizes small
- Text hyphenation, stretching, and letter-spacing (tracking)
- Language-aware TeX hyphenation patterns and optional zero-width breakpoints
- Text rendering modes: fill, stroke, and clipping
- Automatic line breaks, page breaks, and justification

### Layout & Content
- All standard page sizes, custom formats, custom margins, and configurable units of measure
- **HTML** and **CSS** rendering
- **SVG** rendering
- Multi-column layouts and no-write page regions
- Headers, footers, and common page content
- Bookmarks, named destinations, and table of contents
- Automatic page numbering and page groups
- Full page box control (Media/Crop/Bleed/Trim/Art), page reordering, and viewer preferences

### Images & Graphics
- Native **JPEG**, **PNG**, and **SVG** support
- Extended image format handling via GD (`GD`, `GD2`, `GD2PART`, `GIF`, `JPEG`, `PNG`, `BMP`, `XBM`, `XPM`, `WBMP`, `TIFF`, `ICO`, `PSD`, `IFF`, `SWC`)
- Geometric graphics and 2D transformations
- Linear and radial gradients, Coons patch mesh gradients, crop marks, and registration bars
- **JPEG and PNG ICC profiles**, grayscale/RGB/CMYK/spot colors, transparencies, and overprint control

### Security & Standards
- Password and certificate-based document encryption (RC4 and AES, up to 256-bit)
- **Digital signatures** — detached CMS (PKCS#7) signatures with configurable appearance fields
- **RFC 3161 TSA timestamps** — embed a trusted timestamp token from any RFC 3161-compliant Time Stamping Authority (TSA) into the CMS signature; configurable digest algorithm (`sha256`, `sha384`, `sha512`), policy OID, nonce, timeout, and TLS peer verification
- **LTV (Long-Term Validation)** — embed revocation evidence in the same PDF revision as the signature:
  - collects the signing certificate chain and fetches OCSP responses and/or CRL payloads from AIA and CDP URLs
  - deduplicates binary payloads by fingerprint
  - emits `/DSS`, `/VRI`, `/OCSPs`, `/CRLs`, and `/Certs` objects in the catalog
  - each feature (OCSP, CRL, cert embedding, DSS, VRI) can be enabled independently via `setSignature()` LTV options
- **PDF annotations**: links, text notes, file attachments, markup, shapes, media, and widgets
- **JavaScript** embedding
- **PDF/A** (1/2/3, including a/b/u conformance levels) — see [Factur-X / ZUGFeRD](#other) below
- **PDF/X** (generic alias, PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, PDF/X-4, PDF/X-5) — print-exchange conformance: per-variant OutputIntent identifiers, GTS_PDFXVersion in Info dict and XMP, PDF version enforcement, CMYK color forcing for restrictive profiles (X-1a, X-3), transparency restrictions, and suppression of encryption and JavaScript
- **PDF/UA** (generic alias, PDF/UA-1, PDF/UA-2) — accessibility conformance: tagged structure tree (`StructTreeRoot` / `ParentTree`), `MarkInfo /Marked true`, document language (`/Lang`), `DisplayDocTitle true`, `ActualText` for ligatures and special glyphs, figure alt-text tagging, and heading-level clamping to prevent skipped levels; PDF/UA-2 targets PDF 2.0

### Other
- **1D and 2D barcodes** via [`tc-lib-barcode`](https://github.com/tecnickcom/tc-lib-barcode)
- Interactive AcroForm fields (buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, text, combo boxes, list boxes)
- XObject templates and layers with object visibility controls
- Multiple output targets: inline display, forced download, file save, and MIME attachment
- Factur-X / ZUGFeRD workflows via embedded XML in PDF/A-3 documents
- Page compression via the `zlib` PHP extension

---

## Requirements

- **PHP 8.1** or later
- Required PHP extensions: `date`, `pcre` (enforced by Composer)
- Composer

Optional PHP extensions for extended functionality: `gd`, `zlib`.

Feature-specific prerequisites:

- Digital signatures, timestamps, and LTV workflows require signing certificates/keys and any external TSA or revocation endpoints your configuration references.
- `make preflight` depends on external validation tools when you want standards validation beyond the built-in sample generation.

---

## Installation

For a clean first run:

1. Install the package with Composer.
2. Generate the companion font files.
3. Run the minimal script using the generated `K_PATH_FONTS` path.

```bash
composer require tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf
```

Or add to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf": "^8"
    }
}
```

---

## Font Setup

When you install `tc-lib-pdf` as a dependency in your project (via `composer require` or `composer install`), the fonts from the companion package [`tc-lib-pdf-font`](https://github.com/tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf-font) must be generated before they can be used.

Composer does not execute scripts declared by dependencies, so you need to add the font generation step to your **consuming project's** `composer.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "tc-lib-pdf-fonts": [
      "[ -d vendor/tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf-font ] && make -C vendor/tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf-font deps fonts || true"
    ],
    "post-install-cmd": [
      "@tc-lib-pdf-fonts"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
      "@tc-lib-pdf-fonts"
    ]
  }
}
```

This ensures fonts are generated automatically when you run:

```bash
composer install
composer update
composer require ...
```

If you prefer to generate fonts manually, run the build in the `tc-lib-pdf-font` package:

```bash
cd vendor/tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf-font
make deps fonts
```

Equivalent one-liner from your project root:

```bash
make -C vendor/tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf-font deps fonts
```

Once fonts are generated, they are cached in `vendor/tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf-font/target/fonts/` and will not be regenerated unless explicitly rebuilt.

You can also add your own fonts and generate their PHP font data with `tc-lib-pdf-font`. For shared or immutable environments, generate them once into a persistent directory you control (outside `vendor/`) and point `K_PATH_FONTS` to that location.

```php
\define('K_PATH_FONTS', '/opt/app/fonts/tc-lib-pdf');
```

This avoids regenerating fonts on every dependency reinstall and lets multiple deployments reuse the same prepared font set.

---

## Quick Start

The following example assumes the script lives in your project root. If you place it elsewhere, adjust the `autoload.php` and `K_PATH_FONTS` paths accordingly.

```php
<?php

require(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

\define('K_PATH_FONTS', \realpath(__DIR__ . '/vendor/tecnickcom/tc-lib-pdf-font/target/fonts'));

$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf();

$bfont = $pdf->font->insert($pdf->pon, 'helvetica', '', 12);

$page = $pdf->addPage();

$pdf->page->addContent($bfont['out']);

$html = '<h1>Hello, PDF!</h1><p>Generated with tc-lib-pdf.</p>';

$pdf->addHTMLCell($html, 15, 20, 180);

$rawpdf = $pdf->getOutPDFString();

$pdf->renderPDF($rawpdf);
```

`getOutPDFString()` returns the raw PDF bytes. `renderPDF()` streams those bytes to the browser; if you need file storage or an email attachment, keep the returned string and write or hand it off yourself.

For more complete examples — including invoices, images, barcodes, HTML tables, dedicated HTML selector/form/table showcases, PDF/X, and PDF/UA — see the [examples](examples) directory.
Annotation-focused runnable example: [examples/E027_annotations.php](examples/E027_annotations.php).

To run the bundled examples locally:

```bash
make x       # build example assets
make server  # start a local PHP server
```

Then open <http://localhost:8971/index.php>.

If the minimal example fails on first run, verify these two points first:

- `K_PATH_FONTS` resolves to an existing generated font directory.
- The companion fonts were generated after `composer install` or `composer update`.

---

## Remote Resources and `fileOptions`

By default `tc-lib-pdf` **does not fetch any remote URLs**. Images, fonts, and SVG files referenced by HTTP or HTTPS are blocked unless you explicitly allow the originating hosts. Local file paths are never restricted.

Remote access is controlled by the optional `$fileOptions` array passed as the last argument to the `Tcpdf` constructor (and forwarded to `initClassObjects()`).

### Allowing remote hosts

```php
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf(
    unit: 'mm',
    fileOptions: [
        'allowedHosts' => ['cdn.example.com', 'assets.myapp.io'],
    ],
);
```

Only the listed host names are permitted. Any attempt to load a resource from an unlisted host is silently blocked. Supply an explicit allowlist rather than a wildcard to limit the attack surface when user-supplied URLs might reach this code path.

### All `fileOptions` keys

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `allowedHosts` | `string[]` | `[]` (none) | Host names the library may fetch over HTTP/HTTPS. Remote loading is disabled when this list is empty. |
| `maxRemoteSize` | `int` | `52428800` (50 MiB) | Maximum bytes accepted for a single remote download. Requests exceeding this limit are aborted. |
| `curlopts` | `array<int, bool\|int\|string>` | `[]` | Per-request cURL options (keyed by `CURLOPT_*` constants) merged on top of the built-in defaults. |
| `defaultCurlOpts` | `array<int, bool\|int\|string>` | `null` | Replaces the built-in default cURL option set entirely. Omit this key to keep the safe defaults. |
| `fixedCurlOpts` | `array<int, bool\|int\|string>` | `null` | cURL options that are always enforced and cannot be overridden by `curlopts` — useful for pinning TLS settings in locked-down environments. |

### Example: pinning TLS and setting a short timeout

```php
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf(
    unit: 'mm',
    fileOptions: [
        'allowedHosts'  => ['cdn.example.com'],
        'maxRemoteSize' => 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10 MiB
        'curlopts'      => [
            CURLOPT_TIMEOUT        => 10,
            CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT => 5,
        ],
        'fixedCurlOpts' => [
            CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => true,
            CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => 2,
        ],
    ],
);
```

## Digital Signatures

`tc-lib-pdf` supports detached CMS (PKCS#7) signatures with optional RFC 3161 timestamps and LTV (Long-Term Validation) material, all embedded in a single PDF revision.

Signature-focused runnable examples:

- [examples/E007_signature_basic.php](examples/E007_signature_basic.php) : basic detached CMS signature with visible signature fields.
- [examples/E008_signature_timestamp.php](examples/E008_signature_timestamp.php) : detached CMS signature with RFC 3161 TSA timestamp configuration.
- [examples/E009_signature_ltv.php](examples/E009_signature_ltv.php) : detached CMS signature with LTV validation material embedding.

### Basic signature

```php
$pdf->setSignature([
    'signcert'  => 'file:///path/to/cert.pem',
    'privkey'   => 'file:///path/to/key.pem',
    'password'  => '',
    'cert_type' => 2,
    'info'      => [
        'Name'        => 'Jane Smith',
        'Location'    => 'London',
        'Reason'      => 'Document approval',
        'ContactInfo' => 'jane@example.com',
    ],
]);
```

### Adding a TSA timestamp (RFC 3161)

Call `setSignTimeStamp()` after `setSignature()` to request a timestamp token from a trusted TSA and embed it in the CMS unsigned attributes:

```php
$pdf->setSignTimeStamp([
    'enabled'        => true,
    'host'           => 'https://freetsa.org/tsr',
    'username'       => '',
    'password'       => '',
    'cert'           => '',
    'hash_algorithm' => 'sha256',   // sha256 | sha384 | sha512
    'policy_oid'     => '',         // optional OID string
    'nonce_enabled'  => true,
    'timeout'        => 30,
    'verify_peer'    => true,
]);
```

### LTV (Long-Term Validation)

Enable LTV via the `ltv` key inside `setSignature()`. The library fetches OCSP responses and CRL payloads from the certificate's AIA and CDP extensions and writes them into the same PDF revision as the signature:

```php
$pdf->setSignature([
    'signcert' => 'file:///path/to/cert.pem',
    'privkey'  => 'file:///path/to/key.pem',
    'password' => '',
    'ltv'      => [
        'enabled'     => true,
        'embed_ocsp'  => true,   // fetch OCSP responses
        'embed_crl'   => true,   // fetch CRL payloads (fallback)
        'embed_certs' => true,   // include certificate DER bytes
        'include_dss' => true,   // emit /DSS in catalog
        'include_vri' => true,   // emit /VRI map keyed by cert SHA-1
    ],
]);
```

When LTV is enabled the output PDF contains `/DSS`, `/VRI`, `/OCSPs`, `/CRLs`, and `/Certs` objects, making Adobe-style long-term signature validation feasible without any external retrieval at verification time.

### Generating a self-signed test certificate

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout tcpdf.key -out tcpdf.crt
# convert to PKCS#12 if needed
openssl pkcs12 -export -in tcpdf.crt -inkey tcpdf.key -out tcpdf.p12
```

---

## PDF/X Conformance

`tc-lib-pdf` supports multiple PDF/X profiles for print-exchange workflows. Pass the mode string as the fifth argument to the `Tcpdf` constructor:

```php
// Generic PDF/X alias (maps to the library's baseline print-exchange workflow)
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfx');

// Specific variants
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfx1a'); // PDF/X-1a:2003
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfx3');  // PDF/X-3:2003
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfx4');  // PDF/X-4:2010
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfx5');  // PDF/X-5g:2010
```

Each variant automatically applies the appropriate conformance constraints:

| Mode | Min PDF version | Transparency | Process colors | GTS_PDFXVersion |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `pdfx` / `pdfx3` | 1.3 | blocked | CMYK forced | PDF/X-3:2003 |
| `pdfx1a` | 1.3 | blocked | CMYK forced | PDF/X-1a:2003 |
| `pdfx4` | 1.6 | allowed | unrestricted | PDF/X-4:2010 |
| `pdfx5` | 1.6 | allowed | unrestricted | PDF/X-5g:2010 |

All PDF/X modes suppress encryption and JavaScript (not permitted by the ISO 15930 standard).

Runnable examples: [examples/E010_pdfx.php](examples/E010_pdfx.php) through [examples/E014_pdfx5.php](examples/E014_pdfx5.php).

---

## PDF/UA Accessibility

`tc-lib-pdf` supports tagged PDF output conforming to PDF/UA (ISO 14289). Pass the mode string as the fifth argument to the `Tcpdf` constructor:

```php
// Generic PDF/UA alias
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfua');

// Specific parts
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfua1'); // PDF/UA-1 (PDF 1.7)
$pdf = new \Com\Tecnick\Pdf\Tcpdf('mm', true, false, true, 'pdfua2'); // PDF/UA-2 (PDF 2.0)
```

When a PDF/UA mode is active the library automatically:

- Writes a `StructTreeRoot` with a `ParentTree` that maps every page to its tagged content blocks
- Emits `MarkInfo << /Marked true >>` in the document catalog
- Sets `/Lang` (defaults to `en-US` when not explicitly provided)
- Forces `ViewerPreferences /DisplayDocTitle true`
- Maps HTML heading elements (`h1`–`h6`) to PDF structure roles `H1`–`H6` with level-clamping to prevent skipped heading levels
- Tags text content with MCIDs and wraps each run in the appropriate structure element (`P`, `H1`–`H6`, `Link`, etc.)
- Tags `<img>` elements as `Figure` with their `alt` attribute written as `/Alt` in the structure element
- Emits `ActualText` entries for ligatures and special glyphs so text extraction and screen readers work correctly

To provide the document language explicitly:

```php
$pdf->setDocInfo(['a_meta_language' => 'de-DE']);
```

Runnable examples: [examples/E015_pdfua.php](examples/E015_pdfua.php) through [examples/E017_pdfua2.php](examples/E017_pdfua2.php).
